Project: TubedIt
Feature: User should be able to see all shows sorted by rating

I was very interested in the algorithm they would use to rank shows. I expected
that "likes" and "diklikes" would be weighted against ratings drawn from other
APIs. That doesn't seem to be the case, so I looked into their API wrapper. It
turns out TVDB does have their own ratings for each show. I would suggest that
they incorporate existing ratings into a more comprehensive ranking algorithm.

Also, after a once over of their code-base, their code seems to not be
well-factored. API wrappers should be pulled out into their own modules and
referenced by any Model who needs to use it. Also, much of the stub scaffolding
code is still there. Most of it probably wouldn't be too useful, so it should
be removed.

Overall, their project seems promising. I wish them good luck for their demo!
